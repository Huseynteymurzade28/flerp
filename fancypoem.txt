Oh mighty spreadsheet, full of cells,  
Where typos roam and logic dwells,  
A bold font here, italics there,  
The printer jams with devilish flair.

Ctrl + Z, my faithful friend,  
Undo mistakes that never end.  
“Did you mean to paste that twice?”  
Thanks Clippy, yes — your tone’s not nice.

Ode to bugs that hide so sly,  
You crash my code, then wave goodbye.  
Semicolons dance in fright,  
While loops escape into the night.

So copy, paste, and sip your brew,  
This lorem’s here to comfort you.  
Not quite Latin, not quite sane,  
A poem born of coffee brain.
